        <h3>W</h3>e are Appnitro Software, the company behind MachForm.
        Established by Yuniar Setiawan in 2007, weâ€™re a small, privately held
        business based in Malang, East Java, Indonesia. We donâ€™t take outside
        investment, which means that we answer only to our customers and each
        license/service you buy, in turn, helps ensure we can keep doing what we
        love (9 years and counting!). The core team of Appnitro Software has
        known each others for many years. We attended the same college,
        Brawijaya University, and have the same degree, Electrical Engineering.
        That being said, each of us â€“for some unknown, weird, complicated and
        unique reasonsâ€“ is now a software developer ðŸ™‚
